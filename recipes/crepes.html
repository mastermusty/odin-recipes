      <h1>Basic Crepes Dish</h1>
      <em>Here is a simple but delicious crepe batter which can be made in minutes.
         It's made from ingredients that everyone has on hand.</em>
      <h3><em>Ingredients</em></h3>
       <ul>
         <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
         <li>2 eggs</li>
         <li>1/2 cup of milk</li>
         <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
         <li>2 tablespoons of butter milk</li>
       </ul>

       <h3><em>Steps</em></h3>
       <ol>
          <li>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour and the eggs.
             Gradually add in the milk and water, stirring to combine.
              Add the salt and butter; beat until smooth.</li>
          <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium high heat.
             Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle,
             using approximately 1/4 cup for each crepe.
             Tilt the pan with a circular motion so that the batter
             coats the surface evenly.</li>
          <li>Cook the crepe for about 2 minutes, until the bottom is light brown.
             Loosen with a spatula, turn and cook the other side. Serve hot.</li>
       </ol>
